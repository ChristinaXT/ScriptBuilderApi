React/Redux final project for Flatiron School

This is a basic writing prompt app using rails api backend and React/Redux frontend.

The idea is to create story outlines following the form prompts to then use later as ideas for scripts, stories, and so on. The app prompts you to fill out a form with the title, epoch, setting, characters, character_history, summary, scene ideas, notes, etc.

You can save your story ideas on their own page and refer to them later for writing help.

Clone the app,

use localhost 3000 for rails s


use localhost 3001 for npm start
